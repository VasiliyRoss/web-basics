        Dark spruce foimagest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind
        of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading
        light.
        A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and
        cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter
        more terrible
        than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and
        partaking of the grimness
        of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life
        and
        the effort of life.
        It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.

        But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs.
        Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in
        spumes of
        vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the
        dogs, and leather
        traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout
        birch-bark,
        and its full surface imagested on the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to
        force down and under
        the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and narrow
        oblong box.
        There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying
        most of the space,
        was the long and narrow oblong box.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a second man.
        On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten
        down until he would never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an
        offence to it,
        for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to prevent it running
        to
        the sea;
        it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most ferociously and
        terribly
        of all does the
        Wild harry and crush into submission man—man who is the most imagestless of life, ever in revolt against the
        dictum that all movement must
        in the end come to the cessation of movement.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet dead.
        Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with
        the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. This gave them the seeming of
        ghostly
        masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men,
        penetrating
        the land of desolation
        and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a
        world as remote and alien
        and pulseless as the abysses of space.
